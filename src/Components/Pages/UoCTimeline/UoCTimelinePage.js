        <h1>University of Chester Timeline</h1>
        <p>The University has a process for accepting any suggestions staff may have to improve the University.
          A staff member suggested having a wall on campus to show a timeline of the Universityâ€™s achievements over the years.
          I came up with an idea to keep it simple but eye-catching, on each panel it includes an illustration demonstrating
          what happened in that year. This was all designed in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
