        <h1>University of Chester Timeline</h1>
        <p>
          The University has a process for accepting any suggestions staff may
          have to improve the University. A staff member suggested having a wall
          on campus to show a timeline of the Universityâ€™s achievements over the
          years. I came up with an idea to keep it simple but eye-catching, on
          each panel it includes an illustration demonstrating what happened in
          that year. This was all designed in Adobe Illustrator.
