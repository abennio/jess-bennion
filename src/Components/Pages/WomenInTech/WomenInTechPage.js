            I was asked to design a social media post which included motion
            design. I came up with a couple of ideas, one was retro so it worked
            alongside current trends and the other was a more modern take on the
            idea. The idea was to have an eye catching intro so people on
            Instagram would stop and watch the videos to follow in the carousel.
