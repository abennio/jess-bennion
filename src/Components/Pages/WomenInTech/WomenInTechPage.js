          I was asked to design a social media post which included motion
          design. I came up with a couple of ideas, one was retro so it worked
          alongside current trends and the other was a more modern take on the
          idea. The idea was to have an eye catching intro so people on
          Instagram would stop and watch the videos to follow in the carousel.

        />

          src={retro}
          className="women-retro"

        />
